          First of all, welcome to my site! Let me introduce myself, my name is
          Andrew Whitmore and I'm a junior full stack web developer. My story
          begins at the age of four when I received my first computer. Ever
          since, my life has revolved around technology and how it interacts and
          operates. As I was getting older, my parents took note of my interest
          and start enrolling my in tech camps that further increased my
          curiousity.
